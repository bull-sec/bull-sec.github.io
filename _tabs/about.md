I'm [REDACTED] years old and come from [REDACTED] in the [REDACTED]

Enjoyer of pixel art, DOOM, Drum and Bass, Warhammer 40k, and all things related to Information Security.

Most of the things you'll find here someone else has probably written about, but I enjoy writing and it helps gain a proper understanding of the subject matter to try and explain it to someone else. If anyone actually reads these posts then you're essentially my [Rubber Duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) but hopefully someone gains something from these posts.
