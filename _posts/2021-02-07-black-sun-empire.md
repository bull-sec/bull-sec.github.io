Found myself listening to lots of BSE (Black Sun Empire) recently.

BSE are a Dutch group consisting of Rene Verdult and brothers Micha and Milan Heyboer

They make a dark style of Neurofunk but it never goes down the route of being overly technical which is a trap that a lot of Neurofunk producers fall into. BSE have an understanding of the music they make, and they are well aware that the bit that people want is the bit with the Drums and the Bass in it, and they want it to bang as hard as possible, which is pretty much what most BSE tracks do.

If you're into Drum 'n' Bass at all I highly recommend their YouTube channel, which hasn't been updated for a good while now but still hosts a load of their old podcasts which were basically just them smashing out hour long mixes of ear melting Neurofunk. They've moved all the new stuff over to the Blackout Music label page.

They've also been known to do collaborations with everyones favourite Australian DnB groups, State of Mind who are another group I've spent a lot of time listening to over the years.

That's it, that's the whole post. Enjoy some BSE.
