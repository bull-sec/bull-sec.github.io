In the summer of 2016 Bethesda Softworks released an instant classic, an absolute masterpiece of a game that would revitalise a beloved franchise and spawn an entire generations worth of memes. DOOM (2016) for those of you who have been living under a rock since the 90's, is a reboot of the legendary id Software's 1993 classic, DOOM which is the Godfather of First Person Shooter games, it wasn't the first, but it was one of the best and remains a fun game to this day.

From the moment you gain control of the player character DOOM (2016) goes hard. You get the worlds briefest tutorial which teaches you how to perform a "Glory Kill" and simultaneously introduces one of the games main systems. When you perform a Glory Kill on an enemy they drop health and you'll quickly realise that is going to be your main source of replenishing health, because why bother running all the way over to the other side of the room to grab that health pack when there are enemies in front of you and you're armed with a shotgun?

After running through a few corridors, smashing a TV screen or two, killing your way through a room full of Imps and zombies then getting into a lift and smashing some more TV screens the game begins proper. And what a game it is...

The movement, the sounds, the graphics, the music, the feeling. You really just have to play it to fully grasp just how good DOOM (2016) is to play, you can feel every single fibre of the multi-billion dollar game development studio flexing on you, and you can do nothing but marvel at it and bask in the glorious violence that unfolds before you.

DOOM and I'm giving up on adding the (2016) qualifier at this point because we all know which game I'm referring to, basks in it's own ridiculousness and everything is designed to make you feel like an absolute God, which you may actually be. DOOM Guy is no more, Bethesda decided that simply referring to the unhinged gun weilding marine as "DOOM Guy" wasn't metal enough, so you are now "**THE DOOM SLAYER**" *BFG Division Starts playing*, and trust me you will never be able to hear the words **DOOM SLAYER** and not hear the riff from BFG division play in your head for the rest of your life after playing this game, it's a price you must be willing to pay for greatness.

Everything in DOOM works together perfectly, the graphics and general design of the game are spot on and look amazing even in 2022, but they are reliant on the absolutely pitch perfect soundtrack that adds just the right amount of Blood and Thunder to power you through the brilliant level design, which again lends itself perfectly to the expertly designed movement and combat systems. It all goes into the proverbial mixer and the end product is... 

> They released this, this absolute King Shit - Civvie11

If I had to summarise DOOM in a sentence, I'd have to say it's the only game I've ever played where *YOU* are the Final Boss of the game.

> None of you understand. I'm not locked in here with you, you're locked in here with me - Rorschach (from Watchmen by Alan Moore)

After a certain point in the game, i.e. once you pick up the games signature weapon, The B.F.G. which the DOOM Movie famously backronynm'ed into "Bioforce Gun" (But we all know what BFG really means) and you've upgraded your "rune" slots and your other weapons, and your combat armor, you are basically death incarnate and there is very little in the game that actually poses any real threat to you when you're in full flow.

Even on the games hardest initial setting "Ultra Violence, and even when enemies that showed up as mini-boss fights earlier in the game like the Baron of Hell start spawning at the end of multi-wave rooms you have more than enough at your disposal to crash over them like water on a rock. You move faster, you hit harder, you can take more punishment, you *ARE* the most powerful creature in the game and there is literally nothing that can stop you.

That is not to say that DOOM is easy. It is not easy.

Most of the enemies can easily kill you and the AI is actually pretty smart and will try to gang up on you and box you into corners with heavy melee enemies while weaker long range enemies will pepper you from afar, and they all react to your movement and will constantly reposition to try and out fox you. But as I said, you are just far too much for anything in the game to really handle when you're able to utilise the tools the game gives you. Tools such as the chainsaw, which causes enemies to explode with ammunition as you *quite literally* slice them in two from head to toe in perfectly rendered HD graphics.

## Summary

- Not a game for the feint of heart
- Probably not safe for anyone with a heart condition either
- One of the best games made in the last 20 years
- Runs perfectly, I've never personally experienced a crash
- I'm not a metal head, and I love the soundtrack
