## General and Gameplay

Dead Cells is a 2D, single player, rouge-lite, metrodvania game released in 2018 by developers Motion Twin.

Some reviewers have called Dead Cells a "rouge-like" but it's actually a rouge-lite. And it's one of the best games I've ever played.

You start Dead Cells in the bowels of some ancient diseased caste as a relatively weak blob of *something rather evil and green looking* that drops out of a pipe and attaches itself to a headless corpse which is henceforth referred to as "The Prisoner". As The Prisoner you're given a selection of three random weapons of which you can choose two, and released into the world to fight your way through the levels before you ultimately die and start the cycle anew.

At the end of each level you're given the option to invest "souls" that you collect from the denizens of the procedurally generated and beautifully rendered levels into new weapons and items. Once unlocked these weapons and items will appear in your next attempt to defeat the game and will persist with that save game.

Dead Cells is a combat based game, and as such you'll fight your way through the levels until you reach the final boss, The King, and beat the game. Which massively oversimplifies the process and also understates the difficulty and subtle complexity of this game, which is frankly impressive in a single sentence even if I do say so myself.

Dead Cells is **hard**.

But by Bob it's addictive, and ohhhh so fluid.

I have *never* played a game that feels like Dead Cells does. The only thing that comes close is Risk of Rain but that's a zone out feeling of utter dominance and knowing that you're probably not ever going to die after a certain point, this is a feeling of complete and total control whilst also knowingly being a heartbeat away from a grizzly death if you mess up. The controls themselves are perfect, I have no other words for them, just perfect.

Slicing and dodging through groups of enemies while the screen lights up with lighting and environmental effects is such a visceral experience that it's hard to put into words and is better experienced than explained.

Your typical combat encounter beyond the first few enemies will typically contain multiple enemy types, the difficulty of which scale up as you progress through the levels, and you'll be forced to deal with different types of attacks, both ranged and melee, all with different timings which can be learned and parried or dodged. Take the humble Zombie as an example.

He's mean, he's green, and he dies in a few hits.

But he's also one of the most dangerous enemies in the game with his single attack, which is a sort of slashing leap that the game does everything other than draw a giant arrow on the screen to show so that it can be avoided. 1vs1 you'll generally destroy them, but if you miss-time a few of your dodges or jumps you can find yourself in a world of hurt dealing with even two of these guys, and even one on it's own can take some serious lumps out of your health bar if it hits you.

## Graphics

Dead Cells is rendered in Pixel Art.

And it is breathtakingly beautiful at times.

## The Story

There is a story in Dead Cells, though you can very much choose to ignore it.

Dead Cells tells it's story through it's environments, there are clues and notes left from the people that came before you and if you're interested you can piece together the story of how the island was ripped apart by disease.

It's there if you're interested, and there are some interesting threads to pull at, but it's really just there to make the game world feel more fleshed out and it's the main reason for continuing to play (at least it wasn't for me).

## Summary

One of the best ways of having fun without taking your clothes off.
