Automata is a tool I wrote to help me be more organized during my pentesting.

[Automata on GitHub](https://github.com/bull-sec/automata)

It started as a basic wrapper that I wrote around `nmap` because I was doing a lot of HackTheBox at the time and found myself running the same scan a lot.

Then at some point I discovered ANSI escape codes for generating colours within a terminal and it evolved into it's current iteration, which is likely where it's journey ends because if I add any more functionality to it I might as well start writing my own version of `nmap` and I'll be stepping a bit too far into the realms of feature creep.

So what does `automata` do?

In a nutshell; it scans a given target using `nmap`, creates a set of directories, and generates a report template based on the `nmap` results.

It's default scanning mode is a two part scan:

```bash
# First pass, scan ALL ports
nmap <target> -p- -Pn -vvv -n -oN <target-directory>

# Second pass, scan DISCOVERED ports
nmap <target> -p <ports-from-first-pass> -Pn -vvv -sV -sC -oN <target-directory>
```

> It's recommended to follow the tutorial linked below to make sure that you can run `nmap` without sudo or root
