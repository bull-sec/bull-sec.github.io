I hung on for as long as I could, I avoided most of the big shortages and price spikes, but my beloved PC is starting to show signs of age and it's due time to upgrade.

7 years is a decent amount of lifespan, and this old girl isn't actually dead, she's just not particularly healthy.

## Old PC Specs

- Intel i7-4790k (4/8 w/ 8M Cache @ up to 4.40 GHz)
- MSI Z97 Gaming Motherboard
- 32GB Corsair Vengeance 1333MHz RAM (4x8GB)
- MSI NVidia GTX 980
- 2TB SeaGate Mechanical Drive
- 250GB Samsung SSD
- (added recently) 500GB WD Green m.2 SSD

So she was no slouch, and I've been able to play most games at a decent resolution and framerate up until I got into Escape from Tarkov and realised that the old girl was struggling, then a few crashes while playing EFT, Warhammer: Total War 2 and ARMA3 triggered the beginning of the end.

## New PC Specs

- AMD Ryzen 5 5600X 3.7 GHz 6-Core Processor
- be quiet! Dark Rock Pro 4 50.5 CFM CPU Cooler
- NZXT N7 B550 ATX AM4 Motherboard
- Corsair Vengeance LPX 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR4-3600 CL18 Memory (x2 for 64GB)
- Samsung 980 Pro Heatsink 1 TB M.2-2280 PCIe 4.0 X4 NVME Solid State Drive
- Asus DUAL MINI OC V2 GeForce RTX 3060 Ti LHR 8 GB Video Card

## The Case

Astute readers will have noticed that I didn't buy a new case, and that's because #1, I'm not a massive RGB guy, #2 ATX fittings haven't changed since I last bought a case, and least but not least, #3 I love my cube case.
